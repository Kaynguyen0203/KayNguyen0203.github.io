      <h3>Kay Nguyen</h3>
      <p> Hi. I did my A-Levels in Computer Science, Maths and Physics and as of
          05/05/2022, currently, I am a student at City University of London. During My A-Levels,
          most of my programming experience was in Python. Now I am learning Java and soon C++

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Bullet Hell Game</h3>
    <p>
        
	My first programming project in Java, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness. I created a game in which the goal is
    to survive as long as possible. You can move around using WASD but are limited to a
    small box where you are being shot by many bullets from outside.

      <h3>Java project: 2D Game, Tower Defense</h3>
      <p>
    My Java project is a tower defense game where you kill slimes with your sword before they reach your base. It was a great
          opportunity to learn about object oriented programming, model view programming, interaction and GUIs, files, etc.
          Please ignore the filmora watermark. I think I'll use a different program from now on
